# Klipper configuration files
-----
the repository contains all klipper configuration files for my printers.

The main branch keeps the configuration files which are relevant for all printers:
* mandatory macros needed from Klipper
* optional macros for Klipper
* personal macros (if they relevant for all printers)

For each printer there is a separate branch, based on the main branch
